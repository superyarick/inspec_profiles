  title "All uses of the chown command must be audited."
  desc  "
    Without generating audit records that are specific to the security and mission 
needs of the organization, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and 
investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one.
    
    Audit records can be generated from various components within the information 
system (e.g., module or policy filter).

Check the file system rules in \"/etc/audit/audit.rules\" with the following

Note: The output lines of the command are duplicated to cover both 32-bit and 64-bit 
architectures. Only the lines appropriate for the system architecture must be 
present.

-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S chown -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k perm_mod

The audit daemon must be restarted for the changes to take effect."
